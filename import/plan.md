? what do we need to do right now?
1. **Client Proxy Assignment upon Payment**
    - When a client completes payment, automatically assign one of the available proxies to them.
    - Ensure that only proxies marked as "available" are eligible for assignment.
2. **Client Dashboard with Assigned Proxy Display**
    - Display the assigned proxy details in the client’s dashboard after a successful purchase.
    - Provide relevant proxy information, including status, type, and expiration details.
3. **Admin Notification and Proxy Usage Update**
    - Notify the admin whenever a proxy is purchased and assigned to a client.
    - Update the proxy’s status to "in-use" on the admin side, reflecting that it’s currently assigned to a client.
4. **Automatic Proxy Expiration and Renewal Check**
    - Set up a daily check to verify if clients have renewed their subscriptions.
    - If a client hasn’t renewed, mark their proxy as expired, revoke dashboard access, and change the proxy’s status to "available."
5. **Admin Dashboard with Full Proxy Overview**
    - Display all proxies on the admin dashboard, including their current status (e.g., available, in-use, expired).
    - Include relevant information for each proxy, such as assigned client (if any), type, expiration date, and usage stats.
