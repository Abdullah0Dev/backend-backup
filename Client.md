Alright, here’s a plan to tackle this proxy subscription system:

### 1. **Define Database Structure** 🗄️

   - **User Table**: Stores user details, subscription status, payment history, etc.
   - **Proxy Table**: Each proxy has attributes like `proxy_id`, `assigned_user`, `status` (available, in-use, etc.), `expiry_date`, etc.
   - **Subscription Table**: To keep track of each user's proxy subscription, including `user_id`, `proxy_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `renewal_status`, and more.

### 2. **Backend Logic in Node.js** 🛠️

   - **Assigning Proxies**: When a user buys a proxy, check for available proxies and assign one. Update its `assigned_user` and set `status` to “in-use.”
   - **Subscription Renewal Check**:
     - Schedule a **cron job** to run daily, checking if any subscriptions have expired.
     - If expired and not renewed, mark the proxy as available and remove it from the user's dashboard.
   - **Admin Controls**:
     - Build API routes to mark proxies as "available" or "in-use."
     - Admin can make specific proxies available or manage assignments.

### 3. **Frontend Logic with Next.js** ⚛️

   - **User Dashboard**:
     - Display all active proxies for the user with status, expiration date, and renewal options.
     - Include a renewal button for easy subscription extension.
   - **Admin Dashboard**:
     - Create an interface to view all proxies, filter by availability, and assign or revoke proxies.

### 4. **Monthly Subscription & Payment Integration** 💳

   - Integrate with a payment provider (like Stripe) to handle subscription charges.
   - After successful payment, call backend API to extend the `end_date` for the user’s assigned proxy.
   - Set up webhook to automatically deactivate proxies if a user cancels or fails to pay.

### 5. **Error Handling & Notifications** 🔔

   - Add notifications for the user (email or in-app) when:
     - Proxy is about to expire.
     - Subscription renewal is successful or failed.
     - Proxy is removed from their dashboard if not renewed.

With this setup, you'll have a solid foundation to manage user subscriptions and proxy availability effectively! Want help with any specific part?
